## Introduction

The first thing you need to know is that I got certified in 2017. Back then, the exam consisted of 250 questions over 6 hours. I didn't take any course or class for the exam; my method focused on practicing what I had learned (both theoretical and practical). After reviewing the exam content outline, I realized that memorization alone wouldn't work. This method took me almost a year, including one failed attempt.

Before I describe my experience with this certification, it’s important to mention that study methods are highly personal. My approach may help you — or it may not. What’s important is that you develop your own study method that fits your preferences, schedule, and needs. Let’s begin.

## Laying the Foundation

I recommend that before you start studying for the CISSP, you first evaluate your current knowledge. In my case, I took the CompTIA Security+ course and exam, which allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses. You can use a different certification or course, but make sure it covers several of the CISSP knowledge domains. Remember that to sit for the CISSP exam, you must demonstrate at least 5 years of experience in at least 2 CBK domains.

Be honest with yourself. Take a mock exam based on what you currently know. If you don’t want to spend money, there are many practice tests available online that can give you a starting point to identify where you need to focus.

## Deepening the Concepts

After earning my Security+ certification, I started to dive deeper into the areas where I lacked knowledge and experience. I sought out projects where I knew I would learn about specific topics. For example, to learn about cryptography, I worked with digital certificates in email systems. I also worked with IPSec VPN systems and tried to fully understand all the terms used to establish secure communication between two points.

Get comfortable using the command line, as it often allows you to see in detail what is happening, whereas graphical interfaces may hide much of the communication processes. The goal is to accompany theoretical knowledge with practice, which helps you learn and retain concepts better.

I can assure you that for the exam, you need to have a solid understanding of the concepts and then learn their applications. For instance, I vaguely remember a question like:  
*What countermeasures would you use against malicious software?*  
Almost all the answers were technically correct. Without a clear grasp of the concepts, you might miss the best answer.

## Study Materials

I knew from the beginning that weekend courses weren’t compatible with my work and family schedule. A 5-day course also wouldn’t be sufficient for me, as I needed to go deeper into each knowledge domain. So, I decided to study at my own pace.

I bought the official CISSP book on Amazon and began studying.

### ISC2 CISSP Official Book

I reserved 5–6 AM from Monday to Friday to study, take notes, read the book, and jot down any questions or doubts. I didn’t read in order; instead, I started with the topics I was least familiar with. Again, the important thing is to practice the concepts you’re learning as much as possible.

Another method that helped me reinforce my learning was recording myself on my phone explaining the material after each session. Then, on my way to work, I would listen to the recordings repeatedly.

After finishing the official book (I don’t remember exactly how long it took), I supplemented my study with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Certified-Information-Security-Professional/dp/0782144438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another book</a> full of practice questions that explained the reasoning behind each answer.

Nowadays, there’s plenty of information online — videos, audio, mind maps, and more. The key is to organize, prioritize, and start your journey. The books I used likely have newer editions now, so review the available resources carefully, and don’t hesitate to reach out to people who have recently passed the exam. If you don’t know anyone, feel free to DM me — I can recommend some people.

## The Exam

Many people who know me are aware that the certifications listed on my LinkedIn profile are only those in which I truly learned something and invested real effort. CISSP is a challenging, difficult, and comprehensive exam. With the new format, the exam can end early once the system determines the candidate’s performance, avoiding "death by questions."

As I mentioned earlier, I failed my first attempt. Perhaps anxiety played a role, as after 3 hours the exam became mentally exhausting and seemed never-ending. Still, I didn’t hesitate to take the exam again because I felt I was close to passing. How did I know? Because I understood most of the questions and was confident in my answers.

So, I reviewed the material again and scheduled my second attempt a few months later.

## Exam Results

Like the first attempt, the second exam was challenging. But I went in determined to pass — and if I hadn’t, I was ready to try a third time. Finally, I achieved the expected result.

My advice for the exam: don’t spend too much time on any single question. If you know the answer, select it. If not, mark it for review. Don’t exhaust your brain over one question, because questions you’re more comfortable with may appear later.

Don’t fear the exam or failure. If you truly understand the concepts and their applications, you’ll pass. And remember, you always have a chance to retake it.

## What’s Next?

I believe one of the best things about earning the CISSP certification is the self-discipline you develop to continue learning. After certification, you must keep learning and maintaining your CPE credits. In any case, it’s important to specialize in something and deepen your knowledge. Move from "T-shaped" knowledge to "π-shaped" or "M-shaped" knowledge as your career develops.
