## The Journey Begins

Driven by my enthusiasm for technology and programming, I set out to build my first web application. Like anyone learning something new, I started with the basics, and about two and a half months later, I managed to publish a functional mini-application.

The good news is: I enjoyed it. But it required a lot of consistency, as there were moments of stagnation and, of course, the daily workload sometimes made it tempting to set the project aside.

## Technology Stack

For this project, I selected **JavaScript with Node.js** as my programming language. Along with this stack, I leveraged many open-source libraries provided by the amazing developer community.

This journey allowed me to explore new areas in development, cloud, infrastructure, and security. It also brought me closer to technologies like **Linux, NGINX, containers, APIs**, and many others.

## About Cripsos.com

The application is called **Cripsos.com**, and itâ€™s an early warning system for cryptocurrency exchange rates. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Uses **Google API for authentication**.
- Fetches cryptocurrency values via the **CoinGecko API**.
- Sends notifications using the **Mailgun service**.
- Allows users to easily configure alerts and delete accounts if desired.
- Stores no personal information except for your name and email, which are used solely to send alerts.

There are still many features to improve and implement, which I hope to do during my free time. For now, this version represents my **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.

Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.  
Although Iâ€™m not a huge coffee fan, you can still invite me for a cup of tea through **Gumroad**.

## Gratitude

I can't close this article without thanking God for allowing me this opportunity, my family for their support, encouragement, and for sharing in my joy.
